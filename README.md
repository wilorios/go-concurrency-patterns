Golang concurrency patterns

Repository with some examples that explain the golang concurrency patters.

Concurrency is not parallelism. Parallelism is means parallel execution of processes where as concurrency is about design. 

With concurrency you can:

- Design your program as a collection of independent processes.
- Design these processes to eventually run in parallel.
- Design your code so that the outcome is always the same.
